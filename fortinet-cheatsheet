Fortinet : Cheatsheet
----------------------------------------


Basic sniffing command

All Packet sniffing commands start like:

# diag sniffer packet <interface> <'filter'> <verbose> <count> a

diag sniffer packet any 'host 10.55.139.126'
diag sniffer packet any 'host 10.245.32.115 and host 10.244.3.2'


diagnose sniffer packet any 'udp and port 514' 3

execute device replace sn fw-wan-group-hwb1-1 FG1K2D3I16801798
 
 Syntax (Via Console / CLI)

FortiOS

execute disk scan <ref_int>

# execute disk scan 3
scan requested for: 3/Internal (device=/dev/sda3)
This action requires the unit to reboot.


Do you want to continue? (y/n)

FortiOS 5.4.0

diagnose system fsck harddisk
 
 
FortiOS tells us:

<filter> filter for sniffer
Syntax: '[[src|dst] host<IP1>] [[src|dst] host<IP2>] [[arp|ip|gre|esp|udp|tcp] [port_no]] [[arp|ip|gre|esp|udp|tcp] [port_no]]'

If a second host is specified, only the traffic between the 2 hosts will be displayed.

<filter> flexible logical filters for sniffer (or "none").
For example: To print udp 1812 traffic between forti1 and either forti2 or forti3
'udp and port 1812 and host forti1 and (forti2 or forti3)'


diag sniffer packet internal 'src host 192.168.0.130 and dst host 192.168.0.1' 1

To reconnect sooner, you can update the ARP table of your management PC by deleting the ARP table entry for the FortiGate (or just deleting all arp table entries). You can usually delete the arp table from a command prompt using a command similar to arp -d.


fw-tp-fr-st-054-2 (global) $ config system ha
 <Enter>

fw-tp-fr-st-054-2 (global) $ config system ha

fw-tp-fr-st-054-2 (ha) $ end

fw-tp-fr-st-054-2 (global) $ get sys ha

La révision hw est activée sur les deux :

fw-tp-fr-st-054-1 (global) # execute ha ignore-hardware-revision status
The ignore mode is enabled.


fw-tp-fr-st-054-2 (global) # exec ha ignore-hardware-revision status
The ignore mode is enabled.


diagnose sys ha cluster-csum

config global
exec ha ignore-hardware-revision enable
end

fw-tp-fr-st-054-2 (global) # slave's external files are not in sync with master, sequence:0. (type CERT_LOCAL)

Pour résoudre ce problème j'ai du du faire un "exec formatlogdisk" sur le slave, et forcer une synchro manuelle :


Des commandes utiles :

VERIFY PARTITION LOG :
conf wanopt storage
show wanopt storage

get sys status

ACTIVER LA SYNC
config system ha
set sysconfig enable

config global
diagnose sys ha checksum cluster
execute ha manage 1
supergnt
#gntteam;
config global
execute ha synchronize start
diagnose sys ha checksum recalculate
diagnose sys ha checksum cluster
end
exit
exit

execute disk scan 1

COMPARE HA CHECKSUM :
diag sys ha checksum recalculate
diagnose sys ha checksum cluster
get sys ha status
HA commandes :
execute ha manage 0
execute ha synchronize start

- show system ha
- diag sys ha status
- get sys ha status
- diag sys ha checksum clsuter

diag debug reset
diag debug application hasync -1
diag debug application hatalk -1
diag debug disable


Displaying cluster unit age differences
diagnose sys ha dump-by all-vcluster
diagnose sys ha reset-uptime

Temporarily setting a cluster unit to be the primary unit
diagnose sys ha set-as-master enable

Unit A :

    is our preferred master
    has a priority of 200
    is configured with ha override disable


Unit B:

    is our preferred slave
    has a priority of 100
    is configured with ha override disable

Time line:
|
|  t= 0 s : A and B are just booted
|              => ha uptime difference is < 5m, as a consequence HA uptime difference is ignored in master election process
|              => A is promoted master because its priority is higher than B
|
|
|  t=1 mn : A is rebooted
|              => A leaves the cluster but re-joins it as master
|                    This is expected because the ha uptime difference between A and B is less than 5 min
|                    therefor the ha aging condition is ignored in the election algorithm (and A's priority > B's priority)
|
|
...
| t= 15 mn : A is again rebooted
|              => This time A rejoins the cluster as slave
|                     Because ha uptime difference between A and B is greater than 5 minutes
|
| The status is now : B=master, A=slave
|
|
|
|
| t= later... in a maintenance window
|       Administrator wish is to have its preferred master A back as the cluster master.
|       Administrator connects to B (current master) CLI and issue :
|       diag sys ha reset-uptime
|      => this resets B's internal HA uptime making A the oldest one
|      => A is promoted master
|      => B is degraded to slave
|
V

Note : A cli configuration command has been added in 4.00 MR3 to make the default 5 minutes "ha uptime difference" limit configurable.
You can now use "set ha-uptime-diff-margin" for this (default remains 5 minutes)

It was also possible that it did not complete successfully and aborted during execution.  These issues have been corrected as of 5.2.11/5.4.3 or later, and can now be used correctly.
