1. Context and Objectives

Fortis Belgium manages a heterogeneous fleet of firewalls from various technologies and vendors. Currently, the management of these devices involves manual or semi-automated processes, which may lead to inefficiencies, human errors, and inconsistencies in the security policies applied.

The goal of this initiative is to integrate the Playflows solution to automate and standardize the management of security policies across all firewalls. Playflows must enable unified and automated configuration of rules, objects, and security policies, regardless of the specific firewall vendors. All actions related to the configuration, modification, and management of security policies should be streamlined and secured by this solution.

2. Project Scope

The integration of Playflows will cover all firewalls deployed within the Fortis Belgium network, across multiple technologies (multi-vendor). The project will include:

The audit of the current infrastructure (firewalls, configurations, conventions).

Standardization and remediation of configurations.

Execution of a POC to validate the solution in a test environment.

Production deployment of the solution and standardized processes.


3. Project Phases

3.1 Prerequisites

Before starting the integration of Playflows, several prerequisites must be met, primarily focused on auditing the current infrastructure and laying the foundation for future firewall management.

3.1.1 Audit of Fortisâ€™ firewall fleet

A thorough audit of all existing firewalls is essential to gain an overall view of the devices, their specifications, and current policies. This audit will consist of several components:

Inventory of the equipment: identification of firewall models in place, their technical specifications (software versions, capacities, limitations).

Existing standardization and conventions: examination of the standards (or lack thereof) applied to current configurations, including naming conventions, security guidelines, and constraints specific to each environment (production, development, etc.).

CMDB (Configuration Management Database): review of the CMDB to ensure it lists all equipment, with their locations, network diagrams, software versions, etc.

Audit of policies and MEP (Multi-Environment Policy) objects: identification of current security policies, shared objects, and any potential duplicates or inconsistencies.


3.2 Standardization and Remediation

Based on the audit results, a remediation plan will be established to standardize configurations and address potential issues. This step is crucial to ensure that Playflows can operate efficiently and uniformly across all firewalls.

3.2.1 Standardization action plan

Develop a standardization plan: define a uniform configuration model for security policies, adapted to the various firewall technologies used by Fortis.

Remediation recommendations: study current configurations to recommend necessary modifications. This includes correcting inconsistencies, removing duplicates, and harmonizing security objects and rules.

Operational procedures: create a detailed guide for implementing the standards, covering the steps to apply changes to each firewall technology.

Documentation: thoroughly document all actions taken, including justifications for changes made and expected impacts.


3.2.2 Processes and procedures

Establish processes: define and document processes related to future firewall management under Playflows, including change management, updates, and the creation of new policies.

Draft procedures: write standardized operational procedures for the daily use of Playflows, including incident management and support scenarios.


3.3 Proof of Concept (POC)

A POC will be conducted in a lab environment to validate the feasibility of integrating Playflows and to ensure that the solution meets Fortis' specific needs.

3.3.1 Preparation of the POC

Lab environment setup: prepare a test environment that includes firewalls from various technologies, configured with standardized security policies derived from the audit and recommendations.

Baseline testing: test Playflows in this environment to validate the automation of policy management, compatibility with various firewall technologies, and the ability to apply changes without disrupting the network.


3.3.2 Customization of the solution

Customization of Playflows: adjust the solution to meet Fortis' specific needs and constraints, considering the various firewall technologies and local requirements.

Validation of results: ensure the solution meets performance, automation, and rule management expectations. Document any issues and the adjustments made.


3.4 Production Deployment

Once the POC is validated, the solution will be deployed in the production environment. This step will include the deployment of standardized processes and associated tools.

3.4.1 Deployment of the standardized model

Implementation of standards: deploy the standards and remediation measures defined during the previous phase across all production firewalls.

Risk management: establish rollback mechanisms and continuity plans in case of issues during the transition.


3.4.2 Production deployment of Playflows

Deployment of the solution: install and configure Playflows in the production environment.

Team training: train technical teams on the use of the solution, change management, and incident tracking through Playflows.

Technical support: formalize and communicate the technical support process in case of incidents, including the levels of support available and escalation procedures.


4. Deliverables

Audit report of the firewall fleet.

Standardization and remediation plan, including recommendations.

Processes and documentation for the use and management of Playflows.

POC validation and test report.

Production deployment of Playflows and standardized policies.


5. Constraints and Assumptions

The Playflows solution must be compatible with all firewall technologies used by Fortis.

The transition to Playflows must not interrupt critical services during deployment.

Firewall management processes must comply with internal security standards and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR).



---

This approach ensures that all necessary steps for integrating the Playflows solution are thoroughly planned, from the initial diagnosis to the production deployment. It also allows for comprehensive documentation at each stage to ensure rigorous tracking and guarantee the sustainability of the implemented solution.
